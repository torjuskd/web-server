“No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.”
- Heraclitus
</p>

<p>
Consider all the mistakes you have made in your private and working life.
You have probably learnt, re-learnt and changed many times.
You are not the same person as you were a year or even a day ago.
There is no need to ponder past mistakes. Events and outcomes are
external and can only reflect a moment in time, will serve you better
if seen as learning opportunities.
They have passed and are unchangeable, while you have the opportunity
to learn, improve and adapt.
Take responsibility and focus on the present moment.

<p>/usr/bin/setxkbmap -layout no -option "caps:escape"</p>
<p>will do the job on most systems, and can be used to quickly set layout options from the terminal.
 You can also set it to run on startup (eg. under Session and startup on xfce)</p>

<p>Hi and welcome to my site. I will probably use
it mostly for notes, guides and various information
recorded for personal use, but that maybe one day
can be of help to others as well.<p>
