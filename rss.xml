<title>Shell basics: Pipes and redirection</title>
<guid>https://torjusdahle.com/2021.html#shell-basics-pipes-and-redirection</guid>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>
	Every (UNIX) process has (at least) 3 communication channels available to it:
	Standard input (STDIN), Standard output (STDOUT) and standard error (STDERR).
	These are initially inherited from the parent process, so the child process
	does not necessarily know where they lead.
	These can connect to a terminal, a file, a network connection or a
	channel belonging to another process.
</p>

<h3>Symlinks</h3>
<p>
	Stdin, stdout, stderr are presented as files and are actually symlinks to /proc/self/fd/{0,1,2},
	directory listing from /dev:
</p>

<pre><code>
$ ls -la /dev/{stdin,stdout,stderr}
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 15 Jul 27 13:36 /dev/stderr -&gt; /proc/self/fd/2
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 15 Jul 27 13:36 /dev/stdin -&gt; /proc/self/fd/0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 15 Jul 27 13:36 /dev/stdout -&gt; /proc/self/fd/1
</pre></code>

<p>
STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR are in fact guaranteed to correspond to file
descriptors 0, 1 and 2.
Normally in interactive terminal sessions, STDIN reads from the keyboard
and STDOUT and STDERR write their output to the terminal window.
</p>
<h3>Symbols</h3>

<ul>
  <li>&lt; Connect command's STDIN to the contents of a file </li>
  <li>&gt; Redirect STDOUT to file, replace existing file contents</li>
  <li>&gt;&gt; Redirect STDOUT to file, append to file</li>
  <li>2&gt; Redirect STDERR</li>
  <li>&amp;&gt; Redirect both STDOUT and STDERR (From `man bash`: There  are  two  formats  for  redirecting standard output and standard error: &amp;&gt;word and &gt;&amp;word of the two forms, the first is preferred. This is semantically equivalent to &gt;word 2&gt;&amp;1)</li>
  <li>| Connect STDOUT of one command to STDIN of another</li>
  <li>&amp;&amp; Execute second command if only if the previous command succeeded</li>
  <li>|| Execute second command if only if the previous command failed (as in exited with a non-zero status)</li>
</ul>

<p>
	An example of use of redirection to avoid spammy "Permission denied" output:
</p>
<p>
	<code>find / -type f -name test 2&gt;/dev/null</code>

“No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.”
- Heraclitus
</p>

<p>
Consider all the mistakes you have made in your private and working life.
You have probably learnt, re-learnt and changed many times.
You are not the same person as you were a year or even a day ago.
There is no need to ponder past mistakes. Events and outcomes are
external and can only reflect a moment in time, will serve you better
if seen as learning opportunities.
They have passed and are unchangeable, while you have the opportunity
to learn, improve and adapt.
Take responsibility and focus on the present moment.

<title>Binding capslock to escape on modern linux systems and setting layout</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<p>/usr/bin/setxkbmap -layout no -option "caps:escape"</p>
<p>will do the job on most systems, and can be used to quickly set layout options from the terminal.
 You can also set it to run on startup (eg. under Session and startup on xfce)</p>

<p>Hi and welcome to my site. I will probably use
it mostly for notes, guides and various information
recorded for personal use, but that maybe one day
can be of help to others as well.<p>
