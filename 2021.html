“No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.”
- Heraclitus

<p>
Consider all the mistakes you have made in your private and working life.
You have probably learnt, re-learnt and changed many times.
You are not the same person as you were a year or even a day ago.
There is no need to ponder past mistakes. They do not define you.
They have passed and will forever remain immutable, while you will be reborn in infinite ways going forward.
Take responsibility for the present moment and move forward with grace.

<h1>Purpose/content</h1>
<p>Hi and welcome to my site. I will probably use
it mostly for notes, guides and various information
recorded for personal use, but that maybe one day
can be helpful for others as well.<p>
